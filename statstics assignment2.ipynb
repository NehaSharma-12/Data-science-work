    "# Definition: The mean is the arithmetic average of a dataset. It is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values.\n",
    "# Sensitivity to Outliers: The mean is sensitive to extreme values (outliers). A single large or small value can significantly affect the mean.\n",

    "# Use: The mode is useful in categorical data or for finding the most common value in a dataset. For example, it can indicate the most common shoe size or preferred product.\n",
    "# How They Measure Central Tendency:\n",
    "# Mean: Provides the overall average of the dataset, representing the central value if all data points were spread evenly.\n",
