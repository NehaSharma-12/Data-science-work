    "# Statistics can be broadly categorized into two main types: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. Each type serves a different purpose in data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "# Definition: Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the features of a dataset. They provide simple summaries about the sample and the measures, including the central tendency, variability, and distribution of the data.\n",
    "# Examples of Descriptive Statistics:\n",
    "# Measures of Central Tendency: Mean, median, mode.\n",
    "# Measures of Variability: Range, variance, standard deviation.\n",
    "# Measures of Distribution: Skewness, kurtosis.\n",
    "# Example Use Case:\n",
    "# Scenario: A teacher wants to summarize the test scores of a class of students.\n",
    "# Application: The teacher might calculate the mean (average) score, identify the median score, and find the range of scores to understand the overall performance of the class.\n",
    "# 2. Inferential Statistics\n",
    "# Definition: Inferential statistics use data from a sample to make inferences or generalizations about a population. This type involves hypothesis testing, estimation, and drawing conclusions beyond the immediate data.\n",
    "# Examples of Inferential Statistics:\n",
    "# Hypothesis Testing: t-tests, chi-square tests, ANOVA.\n",
    "# Confidence Intervals: Estimating a population parameter.\n",
    "# Regression Analysis: Predicting the value of a dependent variable based on one or more independent variables.\n",
    "# Example Use Case:\n",
    "# Scenario: A pharmaceutical company tests a new drug on a sample of patients to determine its effectiveness.\n",
    "# Application: The company might use a t-test to determine whether the drug significantly improves patient outcomes compared to a placebo. The results from the sample would be used to infer the drug’s effectiveness in the larger population."
